#
# This is my first project with HTML and CSS, I will be attempting to build a stylish website for a local construction company.
# 
# The website will be design focused and attempt to create more business opportunities with a streamlined contact process.
# 
# The website must be highly responsive across all devices and browsers with an emphasis on iOS compatability.
# 
# Must be scalable to include and extensive backend in the future with profiles and acess for company employees to store and access project data.
#
# This build is being hosted on GitHub as a form of documentation for future reference as well as an opportunity to learn how Git works.
# 
# The project includes the old website as a reference under old-index.html.
